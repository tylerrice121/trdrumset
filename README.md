# TR Beat Pad
The TR Beat Pad is a fully functional and responsive audio triggering device.  The user can touch each pad and trigger a sound with preloaded audio files that were created in Pro Tools and Ableton. This application works on touch screens as well as desktops. When on the desktop - the user can trigger each sound using these keys: 'W E R A S D'

The user can switch between drum kits using the dropdown menu at the top of the screen. When on a smaller tablet or smartphone, the user will be prompted to turn the screen to landscape mode for a better user experience.

The design of this application was inspired by the Roland SPD-SX sampling pad.
